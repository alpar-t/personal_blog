    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>So here I am. Just around 10 years late</strong> from when <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/03/a-brief-history-of-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="external">blogs exploded in popularity</a>
But guess better late than never. 
I’m not sure what took me so long. </p>
<p><strong>Social media was never of big interest to me.</strong>
My Facebook account doesn’t get used much, checked less than once a month, without a
mobile presence.
I don’t have many friends there either, and don’t usually accept friend requests. 
Most of my actual <em>friends</em> are surprised to find out I have an account at all, despite the fact 
that it’s older than most. 
Early on, around 2007,  I had a project to create a Facebook clone with a twist to make it
appealing for the elderly, that forced me to make an account.</p>
<p>I tried to use twitter, but must be doing something wrong, 
because there’s no appeal to log-in and even when I do, interest fades away very soon. </p>
<p>Of course news interest me, but a list of hand picked feeds served well for that purpose.</p>
<p>No wonder that I never got to posting anything on social media, how would I know what to
if I don’t consume it? </p>
<p><strong>For a long time, blogs meant the same, but I must admit how wrong I was.</strong> 
These did played a significant role both  professionally and personally.
In fact a single day doesn’t go by without at least glancing at one.
So I am consuming blogs, that should teach me what to write about.</p>
<p>But why would I want to expose my thoughts and ideas to the wild ?
Will someone deem them worthy of their time ?
I postponed several times failing to find an answer, which I now posses.
Creating a technical blog is the loose equivalent of releasing source code with an open source
license. This blog will allow me to better express myself and shape my professional career
by opening up my thoughts and ideas to collaboration with others.</p>
<p>It still feels strange when I imagine anyone in the world could read this, even trough 
most probably very few will, but I am determined to get better at it, and already have a few ideas 
on what to write next. To sustain this, I have pledged to have at least one new post per week. 
It helps that my plan is to write short posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left totake away.

Exupéry</a></footer></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If anything, this first post already made me improve my writhing skills. </p>
